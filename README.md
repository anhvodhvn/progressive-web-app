What is a Progressive Web App?
A Progressive Web App is:
- Progressive: Works for every user, regardless of browser choice because it's built with progressive enhancement as a core tenet.
- Responsive: Fits any form factor: desktop, mobile, tablet, or whatever is next.
- Connectivity independent: Enhanced with service workers to work offline or on low-quality networks.
- App-like: Feels like an app, because the app shell model separates the application functionality from application content.
- Fresh: Always up-to-date thanks to the service worker update process.
- Safe: Served via HTTPS to prevent snooping and to ensure content hasn't been tampered with.
